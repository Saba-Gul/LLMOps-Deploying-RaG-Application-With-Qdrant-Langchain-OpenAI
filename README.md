# LLMOps: Deploying RaG Application with Qdrant, Langchain, and OpenAI

This repository contains the code and resources for deploying a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RaG) application using Qdrant, Langchain, and OpenAI technologies. The project demonstrates how to integrate these tools to build a robust and scalable application for information retrieval and generation.

## Features

- **Document Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess documents for indexing.
- **Document Indexing**: Store documents in Qdrant for efficient retrieval.
- **Question Retrieval**: Use Langchain and OpenAI to retrieve and generate answers from indexed documents.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) (for running the FastAPI application)
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/)
- [Langchain](https://github.com/langchain/langchain)
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saba-Gul/LLMOps-Deploying-RaG-Application-With-Qdrant-Langchain-OpenAI.git
